**A production-like, full-stack sample** showing frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + charts), backend (FastAPI), ML pipeline, Postgres + Redis infra, Kubernetes manifests, CI, tests, and a short recruiter video script.

---

## What's new in this final version (completed tasks)
1. Frontend: polished dashboard, PR risk chart (Recharts), timeline, loading states, and better layout. See `/frontend/pages/dashboard.tsx` and `/frontend/components/PRChart.tsx`.
2. Backend: supports PostgreSQL (via `DATABASE_URL`) and Redis caching for PR analysis results. More unit tests added in `backend/tests/`.
3. Infra: `docker-compose.yml` now includes `db` (Postgres) and `redis`. Kubernetes manifests are in `/k8s` for deployment-ready resources.
4. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs backend tests against a PostgreSQL service and reports coverage placeholder.
5. Docs: Updated README with architecture, run instructions, and a 2-minute video script at `/docs/video_script.md`.

---

## Quick start (local, recommended)
1. Build and run with Docker Compose (recommended):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
2. Frontend: http://localhost:3000 — Backend: http://localhost:8000 (/docs available)
3. Train model (optional, creates `backend/models/pr_risk.joblib`):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/ml/train_model.py
```

## Kubernetes (optional)
Manifests are provided in `/k8s`. These are basic Deployment + Service manifests for frontend, backend, Postgres, and Redis, intended as a starting point for cluster deployment.

## Files of interest
- `frontend/` — Next.js app with charts and improved UI
- `backend/` — FastAPI app with Postgres + Redis support and enhanced tests
- `k8s/` — Kubernetes manifests (deployments + services)
- `docker-compose.yml` — local dev using Postgres + Redis
- `docs/video_script.md` — recruiter-facing 2-minute pitch script

If you want, I can now:
- Push this repo structure directly to a GitHub repo (I will provide files only — you must create the repo and upload), or
- Produce a short README badge image or screenshots (I can provide code that generates SVG badges).
