Title: MergeSense MergeSense — 2-minute Recruiter Pitch

[0:00 - 0:10] (Intro, on-camera)
Hi, I'm <Ambuj>. This is MergeSense, a full-stack project that demonstrates frontend engineering, backend APIs, ML integration, and production-like infra (Postgres, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes).

[0:10 - 0:50] (Problem + demo)
Problem: reviewing pull requests at scale can surface risky changes. In this demo, MergeSense ingests PR metadata and computes a PR risk score to help reviewers prioritize work.
Show the dashboard, highlight PR list, click Analyze to show risk score, and show the Risk Chart updating.

[0:50 - 1:20] (Tech stack)
Built with Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind, FastAPI + SQLModel, a lightweight scikit-learn model, Docker Compose, Postgres and Redis for infra, and Kubernetes manifests for deployment. CI runs tests in GitHub Actions.

[1:20 - 1:50] (Engineering highlights)
Mention: typed APIs, caching with Redis, model training script, SSE stream demo for live updates, and well-structured repo with tests and CI. Point to README for run steps.

[1:50 - 2:00] (Closing)
Thank you — repo link: github.com/AmSh4/MergeSense. I'm happy to walk through architecture or the code in a technical interview.
